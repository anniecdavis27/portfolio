# portfolio
This project is the first of four for my SEI program at GA. The task was to build a portfolio site with the tasks that we have learned so far. 

I knew from the get-go that I wanted my site to feel immersive, so I chose to go with the more traditional multipage site than the single page scroll site. 
The first build was based almost exactly on my wireframes, and it came out exactly as I had imagined. The second build was after I took off my junior developer
hat and put on my recruiter hat. I simplified a lot of the design, and got rid of many of the graphics to account for the time that recruiters spend actually
looking at a person's portfolio. I realized it had to be less showy, and far more straight and to the point -- so that's what I did.

While my project came out looking very different from either, these two portfolios were my two biggest inspirations.

The only issues I ran into were with my dropdown nav bar. The first was that it was not sliding, even if I removed the none class from the initial
class. turns out I had just forgotten to edit the class in one of my media queries. The other is with the text of hte links not transitioning 
properly with the dropdown div. This is still a work in progress, but I will figure it out.
